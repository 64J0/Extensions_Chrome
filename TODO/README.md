# A TODO extension for chrome

The aim of this extension is to show a TODO popup that a user can put the tasks he/she wants to do in the day, and then, when those tasks have been completed, the user could just click in the checkbox to erase that task. **Dopamine boost**

Those informations will be saved in the browser localStorage mechanism.

*This is the first extension that I make :smile:*
